# Meals Plan
Plan your daily meal for each day of a week, and see the shopping list which contains all ingredients necessary to make the planned meals. The app is written using React with Redux. Try out [the demo](https://goo.gl/ipDhyb).   

Its backend is a recipe search [API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) from [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) which provides the possibility to access a pool of over 1.7 million recipes with granularly detail diet information.
